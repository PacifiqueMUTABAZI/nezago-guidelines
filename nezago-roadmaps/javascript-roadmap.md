# Javascript roadmap

## Introduction
Javascript is a broad language and to understand it completely you need a proper understanding of a few concepts and best practices, in this article, I will walk you through the path you need to follow in order to become a great javascript software developer who can do great things with it. I will assume that you have working knowledge with HTML5 && CSS3.

Javascript is the most used language on the internet, it is a monopole language for making website user interfaces, it is the only language that doesn't have any other competitor for its domain. Here I can't hesitate to say that javascript is the native language for user interfaces.
